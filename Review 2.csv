This is particularly because of the multidimensional applications of this eco-friendly technology. The technology depends on the electroactive bacteria, popularly known as exoelectrogens, to simultaneously produce electric power and treat wastewater. Electrode modifications with nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles and iron oxide nanoparticles or pretreatment methods such as sonication and autoclave sterilization have shown promising results in enhancing MFC performance for electricity generation and wastewater treatment. The MFC technology has been also investigated for the removal of various heavy metals and toxic elements, and to detect the presence of toxic elements in wastewater. In addition, the MFCs can be modified into microbial electrolysis cells to generate hydrogen energy from various organic matters. This article provides a comprehensive and state-of-the-art review of possible applications of the MFC technology. This also points out the various challenges that limit MFC performance. Finally, this article identifies the strategies to improve MFC performance for different applications. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. Highlights State-of-the-art information on major applications of MFCs and strategies to improve them is provided in this article. The basic principles of all the applications are thoroughly discussed. The obstacles that limit the technology to use in real-world applications are reported.

We developed a MFC in which microorganisms in the cathode performed a complete denitrification by using electrons supplied by microorganisms oxidizing acetate in the anode. The MFC with a cation exchange membrane was designed as a tubular reactor with an internal cathode and was able to remove up to 0.146 kg NO3--N m(-3) net cathodic compartment (NCC) d(-1) (0.080 kg NO3--N m(-3) total cathodic compartment d(-1) (TCC)) at a current of 58 A m(-3) NCC (32 A m(-3) TCC) and a cell voltage of 0.075 V. The highest power output in the denitrification system was 8 W m(-3) NCC (4 W m(-3) TCC) with a cell voltage of 0.214 V and a current of 35 A m(-3) NCC. The denitrification rate and the power production was limited by the cathodic microorganisms, which only denitrified significantly at a cathodic electrode potential below 0 V versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE).

The synthesis procedure includes synthesis of graphene oxide by modified Hummers method followed by simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide and the formation of hydrogels. The 3D graphene structures are characterized using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy techniques. Electrochemical characterization is carried out to study the capacitive properties and impedance studies of electrodes in conductive electrolyte. 3D graphene electrodes show remarkably high capacitive current, charge storage and lower charge transfer resistance as estimated through cyclic voltammetry and Nyquist plots. In order to evaluate the performance of 3D graphene electrodes in MFC, power density and polarization curves are recorded in three configurations by varying terminal electron acceptors (TEA) viz., dissolved oxygen (MFC-DO), potassium ferricyanide and MFC without TEA (MFC-NDO). 3D graphene electrodes exhibits maximum power density of 0.49 mW/m2 in potassium ferricyanide followed by MFC-DO (0.36 mW/m2) and MFC-NDO (0.34 mW/m2).

Polypyrrole (PPy), a nontoxic conductive polymer, was coated on the plain carbon cloth electrodes to bridge with the biopolymers on bacterial cell membranes and to improve the power production. The PPy-coated electrodes increased the initial power from 20 mW/m(2) to 160 mW/m(2) in the first 4-day period.

Granular activated carbon (GAC), a commonly used bacterial support material with high surface area, exhibited a good bacterial adhesion and high power output. GAC-SCMFCs (single chamber MFCs) generated 5 W/m(3) and maintained the peak power for 6 days.

The A- and NA-SMFC open-circuit voltages were respectively about 665 and 275 mV, with quite steady performances for 120 days. The cell design points of both SMFCs were calculated by implementing polarization curves, and they were at 1 kΩ (power density 8.1 mW/m2 and current density 0.0504 mA/m2 with voltage 150 mV) for NA-SMFC and 100 Ω (power density 252.81 mW/m2 and current density 0.954 mA/m2 with voltage of 275 mV) for A-SMFC, respectively. Cathode potentials were at 30 kΩ 290 mV (NA-SMFC) and 500 mV (A-SMFC). As to the anode, at 30 KΩ, it was −180 mV (NA-SMFC) and 190 mV (A-SMFC). The voltammetry profiles of A-SMFC showed maximum current (forward scan, 22.7 μA; reverse scan, −19.4 μA) followed by NA-SMFC (forward scan, 11.3 μA; reverse scan, −9.5 μA). The cell design points of A-SMFC and NA-SMFC were altered after pH and temperature amendments at 200 and 700 Ω, respectively. As to metal removal rate, the maximum arsenic cadmium and lead removal was observed in A-SMFC at pH 7.0 (77.70%, 90.86%, and 83.91%) and 45°C (66.22%, 79.03%, and 71.17%). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed, at pH 7.0 and 45°C, an optimal biofilm growth at cathode and anode graphite of both SMFCs.

The three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical hybrid electrocatalyst exhibits impressively high electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 138 mV required to achieve a high current density of 100 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, which are significantly higher than those of single MoP nanosheets and WP2 nanorods. Such an outstanding performance of the Mo–W–P hybrid electrocatalyst is attributed to the 3D conductive scaffolds, porous nanosheet structure, and strong synergistic effect of W and Mo atoms in Mo–W–P, making it a very promising catalyst for hydrogen production. Our findings demonstrate that careful control over the morphology and composition of the electrocatalyst can achieve highly efficient hybrid electrocatalysts.",1468,1475,Energy & Environmental Science,9,4,,10.1039/c5ee03801d,Wang

Hence, it is time to think about and examine how to recalibrate this technology's role in a future paradigm of sustainable wastewater treatment. In the past years, many good ideas/approaches have been proposed and investigated for MFC application, but information is scattered. Various review papers were published on MFC configuration, substrates, electrode materials, separators and microbiology but there is lack of critical thinking and systematic analysis of MFC application niche in wastewater treatment. To systematically formulate a strategy of (potentially) practical MFC application and provide information to guide MFC development, this perspective has critically examined and discussed the problems and challenges for developing MFC technology, and identified a possible application niche whereby MFCs can be rationally incorporated into the treatment process.

The efficiency of aerated sediment microbial fuel cells (A-SMFCs) and non-aerated sediment microbial fuel cells (NA-SMFCs) was studied. The A-SMFCs generated a voltage of 580.5 mV between 50 and 60 days, while NA-SMFCs produced a voltage of 510 mV between 60 and 80 days. The cell design point for A-SMFCs was 2 kΩ, while for NA-SMFCs it was 200 Ω. In both SMFCs, the maximum current values relating to forward scanning, reverse scanning and oxidation/reduction peaks were recorded on the 80th day. The anode showed maximum additional capacitance on the 80th day (A-SMFC: 2.7 F cm−2; and NA-SMFC: 2.2 F cm−2). The whole cell electrochemical impedance using the Nyquist model was 21 Ω for A-SMFCs and 15 Ω for NA-SMFCs. After glucose enrichment, the impedance of A-SMFCs was 24.3 Ω and 14.6 Ω for NA-SMFCs. After 60 days, the A-SMFCs reduced the maximum amount of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) ions (80.70%) and Cu(II) to Cu(I) ions (72.72%), and showed maximum intracellular uptake of Ni(II) ions (80.37%); the optimum remediation efficiency of NA-SMFCs was after 80 days toward Cr(VI) ions (67.36%), Cu(II) ions (59.36%) and Ni(II) ions (52.74%). Both SMFCs showed highest heavy metal reduction and power generation at a pH of 7.0. SEM images and 16S rRNA gene analysis showed a diverse bacterial community in both A-SMFCs and NA-SMFCs. The performance of A-SMFCs showed that they could be exercised as durable and efficient technology for power production and the detoxification of heavy metal sediments.

Their electrochemical performances and the dominant microbial communities of the electrode biofilms were compared. The electrodes were identical in shape, macroscopic surface area, and core material but differed in either surface coating (Pt- or Ta-coated metal composites) or surface texture (smooth or rough). The MFC was inoculated with electrochemically active, neutrophilic microorganisms that had been enriched in the anodic compartments of acetate-fed MFCs over a period of 4 years. The original inoculum consisted of bioreactor sludge samples amended with Geobacter sulfurreducens strain PCA. Overall, the Pt- and Ta-coated Ti bioanodes (electrode-biofilm association) showed higher current production than the uncoated Ti bioanodes. Analyses of extracted DNA of the anodic liquid and the Pt- and Ta-coated Ti electrode biofilms indicated differences in the dominant bacterial communities.

The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode is usually the limiting step in microbial fuel cells and improvements have to be done to increase the performances and reduce the cost. For the first time, iron-based catalysts were synthesized utilizing the polymerization-pyrolysis method and tested successfully in neutral media and in working microbial fuel cells (MFCs). The catalysts were synthesized using polymerization, salt formation, mixed with iron salt and pyrolyzed at 850°C (PABA-850) and 950°C (PABA- 950) respectively. To study the kinetics, electro-activity of the catalysts was investigated using rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE). Results showed that PABA-850 had higher catalytic activity compared to that of PABA-950. Both Fe-catalysts had much better activity compared to activated carbon (AC) used as a baseline. Catalysts were then integrated into air breathing cathodes (loading 1 mg cm-2) and tested in single chamber MFC. The power peak obtained was 178 ± 3 μWcm-2 for PABA-850. Comparable power was produced from PABA-950 (173 ± 3 μWcm-2). AC power output was 131 ± 4 μWcm-2 that was roughly 40% lower compared to Fe-based catalysts.

However, low power output and high cost have severely hindered their practical application. The present study prepared a monolithic three-dimensional graphene (3D-G) electrode through a self-assembly method. The as-prepared 3D-G electrode featured inflexibility, a crumpled surface, a macroporous structure (with pore spaces of dozens of microns), high specific surface area (188.32 m2 g−1), good conductivity and low cost, favoring high bacterial loading capacity and enhancing the extracellular electron transfer (EET) efficiency. Equipped with the prepared 3D-G anode in an air-cathode single chamber MFC reactor, the maximum power density (Pmax) increased to 1516 ± 87 mW m−2 in the 3D-G reactor from 877 ± 57 mW m−2 in the graphite felt (GF) control and from 584 ± 39 mW m−2 in the carbon cloth (CC) control after 2 weeks of operation. Moreover, the Pmax of the reactor with the 3D-G anode decreased only by 15% after 2 months of operation, which showed durability of the anode due to having macropores which are not easily blocked. Normalized to the cost of the anode, the Pmax in the 3D-G reactor was 93 and 133 times those in the GF and CC reactors, respectively. Dynamic analysis results (CV, Tafel and EIS) showed that the 3D-G anode improved the efficiency of EET due to having an appropriate structure and good conductivity.

SMFCs are a novel technology for the simultaneous production of renewable energy and bioremediation of heavy metals. Recently, SMFCs have attracted the attention of many researchers because of their moderate functioning parameters and ability to use a range of biodegradable substrates like glucose, glutamic acid, river water, cysteine, acetate, and starch. The inocula used in SMFCs include river sediment, marine sediment, and wastewater. For power generation, many exoelectrogens in SMFCs have the ability to transfer electrons from electrodes by using natural electron shuttles. Exoelectrogens use four primary pathways to transfer electrons to the electrodes, including short-range electron transfer through redox-active proteins, soluble electron shuttling molecules, long-range electron transport by conductive pili, and direct interspecies electron transfer. The most dominant mechanism is long-range electron transfer via conductive pili because pili have metal-like conductivity. The powering by microbes is an emerging technique for the remediation of heavy metals from sediments. The pathways for transferring electrons in electrotrophs operate in the opposite direction from those in exoelectrogens. To further upgrade SMFC technology, this review targets the prototype, operating factors, working mechanisms, applications, and future perspectives of SMFCs.

This study demonstrated the electricity generation from the synthetic wastewater in a two chambered microbial fuel cell (MFC) inoculated with a mixed culture of cellulose degrading bacteria (CDB). With an initial addition of a nutrient broth having concentration of 13 g/l the power density reached 469.48 W/m 2 ; while the maximum voltage reached is 1.0 V. The maximum power for this two chambered MFC was 1.0 W (at current of 1.0 Amp). These results demonstrated that electricity can be produced from the synthetic wastewater by exploiting CDB as the biocatalyst. In this case, the synthetic wastewater consists of cellulosic material and hence the most suitable mixed culture of bacteria is cellulose degrading bacteria. The research study of this kind was done first time and provided satisfactory good results.

However, these technologies require the use of highly active and stable catalysts to make these applications feasible. Current catalysts consist of precious metals such as platinum and iridium, which are expensive and block common access to electrochemical energy. Transition metals, and their oxides, serve as a promising alternative to these precious metals. due to their intrinsic activity and sufficient stability in oxidative electrochemical environments. Among wide range of these metals, cobalt, manganese, nickel, and iron, have been extensively explored as bifunctional catalysts, capable of simultaneously catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for energy storage and conversion. Not only do they show innate electrochemical capabilities, but their structural diversity, as well as their ability to be mixed, doped, and combined with other materials such as graphene, make transition metal oxides a highly attractive subject in electrochemical and materials research. This review serves to summarize the research currently available concerning transition metal oxides, and their applications as a bifunctional catalyst for the utilized fuel cells and rechargeable metal-air batteris in alkaline media.

In this study, we propose a new application of the SS-derived biochar as an advanced bifunctional electrode material (anode and cathode) in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). To function as an anode, the SS amended with various amounts of coconut shell was pressed into a mold and then converted into SS-derived carbon monoliths (SMs) by heat treatment.

The maximum power density of 969 ± 28 mW m−2 was achieved from the MFC with a SM anode and a PSM cathode, which was ca. 2.4 times that of the MFC with a graphite anode and a Pt cathode. The enhanced electrical conductivity of the SMs caused by amending the coconut shell resulted in the enrichment of exoelectrogens and the decrease in electron transfer resistance, which were responsible for the excellent performances of the as-prepared electrodes.

The concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were reduced to well below their permissible limits. Moreover, the growth of the bacterial consortium in cathode causes an increased electricity production in the cell because of the increased bacterial activity. The performance of the cell with a bicarbonate buffered solution in the cathode was superior to that obtained with the commonly used phosphate buffered solution. As bicarbonate is the natural buffering agent found in the sea, the use of bicarbonate buffered solutions is eco-friendly. The same seawater bacterial consortium was used in both the anode and the cathode, confirming their adaptability to different environments.

Due to the ability of the MFC to oxidize a wide spectrum of substrates, wastewater seems to be one of the most interesting fuels. Unfortunately, wastewater could contain electron acceptors such as nitrate, which could interfere with the electrical performance of the MFC. In this work, the influence of oxidised nitrogen forms on the electricity production of an air breathing MFC was studied. It was observed that power generation was not significantly influenced when operated at nitrate concentrations below 0.9 mg N-NO3 L−1. However, when the nitrate concentrations were above this value, the electricity generation was reduced. In order to investigate the causes of this reduction, an electrochemical characterization of the MFC was performed. The results of polarization curves were fitted to an empirical mathematical model. From the results it was observed that, when nitrate was present, the denitrifiers outcompeted the electrogenic microorganisms for substrate, causing mass transfer limitations to the electrogenic process.",1,6,Applied Energy,250,NA,,10.1016/j.apenergy.2019.05.043,Marks

Carbon cloth and carbon paper materials typically used in hydrogen fuel cells, however, are prohibitively expensive for use in MFCs. An inexpensive carbon mesh material was examined here as a substantially less expensive alternative to these materials for the anode in an MFC. Pretreatment of the carbon mesh was needed to ensure adequate MFC performance. Heating the carbon mesh in a muffle furnace (450 degrees C for 30 min) resulted in a maximum power density of 922 mW/m2 (46 W/m3) with this heat-treated anode, which was 3% more power than that produced using a mesh anode cleaned with acetone (893 mW/ m2; 45 W/m3). This power density with heating was only 7% less than that achieved with carbon cloth treated by a high temperature ammonia gas process (988 mW/m2; 49 W/m3). When the carbon mesh was treated by the ammonia gas process, power increased to 1015 mW/m2(51 W/m3). Analysis of the cleaned or heated surfaces showed these processes decreased atomic O/C ratio, indicating removal of contaminants that interfered with charge transfer. Ammonia gas treatment also increased the atomic N/C ratio, suggesting that this process produced nitrogen related functional groups that facilitated electron transfer. These results show that low cost heat-treated carbon mesh materials can be used as the anode in an MFC, providing good performance and even exceeding performance of carbon cloth anodes.",6870,6874,Environmental science & technology,43,17,,10.1021/es900997w,Wang
