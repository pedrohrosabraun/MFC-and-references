PY  - 2017
AB  - ummary
Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are emerging as a versatile renewable energy technology. This is particularly because of the multidimensional applications of this eco-friendly technology. The technology depends on the electroactive bacteria, popularly known as exoelectrogens, to simultaneously produce electric power and treat wastewater. Electrode modifications with nanomaterials such as gold nanoparticles and iron oxide nanoparticles or pretreatment methods such as sonication and autoclave sterilization have shown promising results in enhancing MFC performance for electricity generation and wastewater treatment. The MFC technology has been also investigated for the removal of various heavy metals and toxic elements, and to detect the presence of toxic elements in wastewater. In addition, the MFCs can be modified into microbial electrolysis cells to generate hydrogen energy from various organic matters. This article provides a comprehensive and state-of-the-art review of possible applications of the MFC technology. This also points out the various challenges that limit MFC performance. Finally, this article identifies the strategies to improve MFC performance for different applications. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Biological denitrification in microbial fuel cells.
PY  - 2007
AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) that remove carbon as well as nitrogen compounds out of wastewater are of special interest for practice. We developed a MFC in which microorganisms in the cathode performed a complete denitrification by using electrons supplied by microorganisms oxidizing acetate in the anode. The MFC with a cation exchange membrane was designed as a tubular reactor with an internal cathode and was able to remove up to 0.146 kg NO3--N m(-3) net cathodic compartment (NCC) d(-1) (0.080 kg NO3--N m(-3) total cathodic compartment d(-1) (TCC)) at a current of 58 A m(-3) NCC (32 A m(-3) TCC) and a cell voltage of 0.075 V. The highest power output in the denitrification system was 8 W m(-3) NCC (4 W m(-3) TCC) with a cell voltage of 0.214 V and a current of 35 A m(-3) NCC. The denitrification rate and the power production was limited by the cathodic microorganisms, which only denitrified significantly at a cathodic electrode potential below 0 V versus standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). This is, to our knowledge, the first study in which a MFC has both a biological anode and cathode performing simultaneous removal of an organic substrate, power production, and complete denitrification without relying on H-2-formation or external added power.

TI  - Conversion of wastes into bioelectricity and chemicals by using microbial electrochemical technologies.
PY  - 2012
AB  - Waste biomass is a cheap and relatively abundant source of electrons for microbes capable of producing electrical current outside the cell. Rapidly developing microbial electrochemical technologies, such as microbial fuel cells, are part of a diverse platform of future sustainable energy and chemical production technologies. We review the key advances that will enable the use of exoelectrogenic microorganisms to generate biofuels, hydrogen gas, methane, and other valuable inorganic and organic chemicals. Moreover, we examine the key challenges for implementing these systems and compare them to similar renewable energy technologies. Although commercial development is already underway in several different applications, ranging from wastewater treatment to industrial chemical production, further research is needed regarding efficiency, scalability, system lifetimes, and reliability.

TI  - Microbial fuel cells: From fundamentals to applications. A review
PY  - 2017
AB  - In the past 10–15 years, the microbial fuel cell (MFC) technology has captured the attention of the scientific community for the possibility of transforming organic waste directly into electricity through microbially catalyzed anodic, and microbial/enzymatic/abiotic cathodic electrochemical reactions. In this review, several aspects of the technology are considered. Firstly, a brief history of abiotic to biological fuel cells and subsequently, microbial fuel cells is presented. Secondly, the development of the concept of microbial fuel cell into a wider range of derivative technologies, called bioelectrochemical systems, is described introducing briefly microbial electrolysis cells, microbial desalination cells and microbial electrosynthesis cells. The focus is then shifted to electroactive biofilms and electron transfer mechanisms involved with solid electrodes. Carbonaceous and metallic anode materials are then introduced, followed by an explanation of the electro catalysis of the oxygen reduction reaction and its behavior in neutral media, from recent studies. Cathode catalysts based on carbonaceous, platinum-group metal and platinum-group-metal-free materials are presented, along with membrane materials with a view to future directions. Finally, microbial fuel cell practical implementation, through the utilization of energy output for practical applications, is described.

TI  - Fabrication of three-dimensional graphene anode for augmenting performance in microbial fuel cells
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract In the present work, we have reported the synthesis of 3D graphene structures by simple chemical reduction method for application in microbial fuel cell (MFC) as an anode. The synthesis procedure includes synthesis of graphene oxide by modified Hummers method followed by simultaneous reduction of graphene oxide and the formation of hydrogels. The 3D graphene structures are characterized using X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy techniques. Electrochemical characterization is carried out to study the capacitive properties and impedance studies of electrodes in conductive electrolyte. 3D graphene electrodes show remarkably high capacitive current, charge storage and lower charge transfer resistance as estimated through cyclic voltammetry and Nyquist plots. In order to evaluate the performance of 3D graphene electrodes in MFC, power density and polarization curves are recorded in three configurations by varying terminal electron acceptors (TEA) viz., dissolved oxygen (MFC-DO), potassium ferricyanide and MFC without TEA (MFC-NDO). 3D graphene electrodes exhibits maximum power density of 0.49 mW/m2 in potassium ferricyanide followed by MFC-DO (0.36 mW/m2) and MFC-NDO (0.34 mW/m2). Present work highlights the viability of chemically synthesized 3D graphene electrodes as an efficient anode material in MFC.

TI  - Anode modification by biogenic gold nanoparticles for the improved performance of microbial fuel cells and microbial community shift
PY  - 2018
AB  - In this study, carbon cloth anodes were modified using biogenic gold nanoparticles (BioAu) and nanohybrids of multi-walled carbon nanotubes blended with BioAu (BioAu/MWCNT) to improve the performance of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). The results demonstrated that BioAu modification significantly enhanced the electricity generation of MFCs. In particular, BioAu/MWCNT nanohybrids as the modifier displayed a better performance. The MFC with the BioAu/MWCNT electrode had the shortest start-up time (6.74 d) and highest power density (178.34 ± 4.79 mW/m2), which were 141.69% shorter and 56.11% higher compared with those of the unmodified control, respectively. These improvements were attributed to the excellent electrocatalytic activity and strong affinity towards exoelectrogens of the BioAu/MWCNT nanohybrids on the electrode. High throughput sequencing analysis indicated that the relative abundance of electroactive bacteria in the biofilm community, mostly from the classes of Gammaproteobacteria and Negativicutes, increased after anode modification.

TI  - Novel electrode materials to enhance the bacterial adhesion and increase the power generation in microbial fuel cells (MFCs)
PY  - 2009
AB  - In this study, two novel electrode materials were tested to enhance bacterial adhesion and increase power production in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). Polypyrrole (PPy), a nontoxic conductive polymer, was coated on the plain carbon cloth electrodes to bridge with the biopolymers on bacterial cell membranes and to improve the power production. The PPy-coated electrodes increased the initial power from 20 mW/m(2) to 160 mW/m(2) in the first 4-day period. But there was no clear difference between two PPy coating thicknesses (5-cycle coating and 50-cycle coating) in terms of the bacterial adhesion and power production. Granular activated carbon (GAC), a commonly used bacterial support material with high surface area, exhibited a good bacterial adhesion and high power output. GAC-SCMFCs (single chamber MFCs) generated 5 W/m(3) and maintained the peak power for 6 days. Compared with plain carbon cloth electrodes, GAC-SCMFCs had lower internal resistances and higher power generations. However, GAC-SCMFCs had lower columbic efficiency and energy conversion efficiency than the conventional two chamber MFCs.

TI  - Enhanced bioremediation of toxic metals and harvesting electricity through sediment microbial fuel cell
PY  - 2017
AB  - Summary
Performance of sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) with aerated (A-SMFC) and nonaerated (NA-SMFC) cathodes was evaluated at different operating conditions in toxic metal removal and power generation. The A- and NA-SMFC open-circuit voltages were respectively about 665 and 275 mV, with quite steady performances for 120 days. The cell design points of both SMFCs were calculated by implementing polarization curves, and they were at 1 kΩ (power density 8.1 mW/m2 and current density 0.0504 mA/m2 with voltage 150 mV) for NA-SMFC and 100 Ω (power density 252.81 mW/m2 and current density 0.954 mA/m2 with voltage of 275 mV) for A-SMFC, respectively. Cathode potentials were at 30 kΩ 290 mV (NA-SMFC) and 500 mV (A-SMFC). As to the anode, at 30 KΩ, it was −180 mV (NA-SMFC) and 190 mV (A-SMFC). The voltammetry profiles of A-SMFC showed maximum current (forward scan, 22.7 μA; reverse scan, −19.4 μA) followed by NA-SMFC (forward scan, 11.3 μA; reverse scan, −9.5 μA). The cell design points of A-SMFC and NA-SMFC were altered after pH and temperature amendments at 200 and 700 Ω, respectively. As to metal removal rate, the maximum arsenic cadmium and lead removal was observed in A-SMFC at pH 7.0 (77.70%, 90.86%, and 83.91%) and 45°C (66.22%, 79.03%, and 71.17%). Scanning electron microscopy confirmed, at pH 7.0 and 45°C, an optimal biofilm growth at cathode and anode graphite of both SMFCs. After 120 days of operation, genomic DNA was extracted from biofilms and analyzed for rDNA 16S sequences. Similarity search was performed by using Basic Local Alignment Search Tool algorithm against the National Center for Biotechnology Information Gen Bank showing Pseudomonas spp. dominance at both anode and cathode. The results revealed that the A-SMFC system could be employed as an effective and long-term tool for power generation as well as stimulated bioremediation of the polluted sediments.

TI  - Isolation, identification, characterization, and evaluation of cadmium removal capacity of Enterobacter species
PY  - 2014
AB  - This study focused on the isolation and characterization of high cadmium-resistant bacterial strains, possible exploitation of its cadmium-accumulation and cadmium-induced proteins. Cadmium-resistant bacterial strains designated as RZ1 and RZ2 were isolated from industrial wastewater of Penang, Malaysia. These isolates were identified as Enterobacter mori and Enterobacter sp. WS12 on the basis of phenotypic, biochemical and 16S rDNA sequence based molecular phylogenetic characteristics. Both isolates were Gram negative, cocci, and growing well in Lauria-Bertani broth medium at 35 °C temperature and pH 7.0. Results also indicated that Enterobacter mori and Enterobacter sp. WS12are capable to remove 87.75 and 85.11% of the cadmium from 100 µg ml(-1) concentration, respectively. This study indicates that these strains can be useful as an inexpensive and efficient bioremediation technology to remove and recover the cadmium from wastewater.

TI  - Hierarchical Mesoporous SnO2 Nanosheets on Carbon Cloth: A Robust and Flexible Electrocatalyst for CO2 Reduction with High Efficiency and Selectivity
PY  - 2016
AB  - Electrochemical reduction of CO2 into liquid fuels is a promising approach to achieve a carbon-neutral energy cycle. However, conventional electrocatalysts usually suffer from low energy efficiency and poor selectivity and stability. A 3D hierarchical structure composed of mesoporous SnO2 nanosheets on carbon cloth is proposed to efficiently and selectively electroreduce CO2 to formate in aqueous media. The electrode is fabricated by a facile combination of hydrothermal reaction and calcination. It exhibits an unprecedented partial current density of about 45 mA cm−2 at a moderate overpotential (0.88 V) with high faradaic efficiency (87±2 %), which is even larger than most gas diffusion electrodes. Additionally, the electrode also demonstrates flexibility and long-term stability. The superior performance is attributed to the robust and highly porous hierarchical structure, which provides a large surface area and facilitates charge and mass transfer.

In XRD, it indicates the decreased intensity after laser ablation but no change in peak positions resulted as graphite is very strong and hard material. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) used to evaluate structural characteristics shows the overlapping layered structure after ablation. Reduced graphene oxide (rGO) is prepared by using modified Hummers' method and reduced it by thermal reduction method. UV–Vis spectra confirmed the peaks of graphite and rGO at 274 nm and 267 nm, respectively. To study the carrier relaxation dynamics of graphite and rGO, ultrafast Visible-pump/NIR-probe femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy was used. Carrier relaxation occurred between 260 and 309 fs even after laser ablation damage, which is useful for future application of optical switching under high laser repetition.

TI  - Research Progress on Applications of Polyaniline (PANI) for Electrochemical Energy Storage and Conversion.
PY  - 2020
AB  - Conducting polyaniline (PANI) with high conductivity, ease of synthesis, high flexibility, low cost, environmental friendliness and unique redox properties has been extensively applied in electrochemical energy storage and conversion technologies including supercapacitors, rechargeable batteries and fuel cells. Pure PANI exhibits inferior stability as supercapacitive electrode, and can not meet the ever-increasing demand for more stable molecular structure, higher power/energy density and more N-active sites. The combination of PANI and other active materials like carbon materials, metal compounds and other conducting polymers (CPs) can make up for these disadvantages as supercapacitive electrode. As for rechargeable batteries and fuel cells, recent research related to PANI mainly focus on PANI modified composite electrodes and supported composite electrocatalysts respectively. In various PANI based composite structures, PANI usually acts as a conductive layer and network, and the resultant PANI based composites with various unique structures have demonstrated superior electrochemical performance in supercapacitors, rechargeable batteries and fuel cells due to the synergistic effect. Additionally, PANI derived N-doped carbon materials also have been widely used as metal-free electrocatalysts for fuel cells, which is also involved in this review. In the end, we give a brief outline of future advances and research directions on PANI.

TI  - L-Cysteine tailored porous graphene aerogel for enhanced power generation in microbial fuel cells
PY  - 2015
AB  - Graphene aerogel prepared from a solution is a good candidate for a microbial fuel cell (MFC) anode as it possesses a three dimensional porous structure for high biocatalyst loading. However, the surface modification and pore size adjustment are always required during the synthetic process. In this study, a highly biocompatible porous graphene aerogel is developed using a one-pot synthesis with L-cysteine as the reductant. The addition of L-cysteine not only reduces the graphene oxide at around 80 °C under an inert atmosphere but also tailors the pore size and structure of the aerogel. With the optimized ratio of L-cysteine in the precursor, the obtained graphene aerogel GIII exhibits a highly hydrophilic surface and appropriate pore structure for bacteria moving in and adhesion. Increasing the loading of bacterial cells on the GIII anode enables it to achieve a maximum power density of 679.7 mW m−2, which is around a 1.6 fold higher than the graphene aerogel prepared using a hydrothermal method. This study provides a new way to prepare three-dimensional porous biocompatible anode materials for improving MFC performance.

TI  - Novel porous molybdenum tungsten phosphide hybrid nanosheets on carbon cloth for efficient hydrogen evolution
PY  - 2016
AB  - Nanostructural modification and chemical composition tuning are paramount to developing effective non-noble hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts for water splitting. Herein, we report a novel excellent porous molybdenum tungsten phosphide (Mo–W–P) hybrid nanosheet catalyst for hydrogen evolution, which is synthesized via in situ phosphidation of molybdenum tungsten oxide (Mo–W–O) hybrid nanowires grown on carbon cloth. The three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical hybrid electrocatalyst exhibits impressively high electrocatalytic activity with a low overpotential of 138 mV required to achieve a high current density of 100 mA cm−2 and a small Tafel slope of 52 mV dec−1 in 0.5 M H2SO4, which are significantly higher than those of single MoP nanosheets and WP2 nanorods. Such an outstanding performance of the Mo–W–P hybrid electrocatalyst is attributed to the 3D conductive scaffolds, porous nanosheet structure, and strong synergistic effect of W and Mo atoms in Mo–W–P, making it a very promising catalyst for hydrogen production. Our findings demonstrate that careful control over the morphology and composition of the electrocatalyst can achieve highly efficient hybrid electrocatalysts.

TI  - Activated carbon cloth as anode for sulfate removal in a microbial fuel cell.
PY  - 2008
AB  - By employing the sulfate-reducing bacterium Desulfovibrio desulfuricans we demonstrate the possibility of electricity generation in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) with concomitant sulfate removal. This approach is based on an in situ anodic oxidative depletion of sulfide produced by D. desulfuricans. Three different electrode materials, graphite foil (GF), carbon fiber veil (CFV), and high surface area activated carbon cloth (ACC), were evaluated for sulfide electrochemical oxidation. In comparison to CFV and GF electrodes, ACC was a superior material for sulfide adsorption and oxidation and showed significant potential for harvesting energy from sulfate-rich solutions in the form of electricity. Sulfate (3.03 g dm−3) was removed from a bacterial suspension, which represented 99% removal. A maximum power density of 0.51 mW cm−2 (normalized to geometric electrode area) was obtained with a one-chamber, air-breathing cathode and continuous flow MFC operated in batch mode at 22 °C.

TI  - Towards sustainable wastewater treatment by using microbial fuel cells-centered technologies
PY  - 2013
AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have been conceived and intensively studied as a promising technology to achieve sustainable wastewater treatment. However, doubts and debates arose in recent years regarding the technical and economic viability of this technology on a larger scale and in a real-world applications. Hence, it is time to think about and examine how to recalibrate this technology's role in a future paradigm of sustainable wastewater treatment. In the past years, many good ideas/approaches have been proposed and investigated for MFC application, but information is scattered. Various review papers were published on MFC configuration, substrates, electrode materials, separators and microbiology but there is lack of critical thinking and systematic analysis of MFC application niche in wastewater treatment. To systematically formulate a strategy of (potentially) practical MFC application and provide information to guide MFC development, this perspective has critically examined and discussed the problems and challenges for developing MFC technology, and identified a possible application niche whereby MFCs can be rationally incorporated into the treatment process. We propose integration of MFCs with other treatment technologies to form an MFC-centered treatment scheme based on thoroughly analyzing the challenges and opportunities, and discuss future efforts to be made for realizing sustainable wastewater treatment.

TI  - Studies on the biodegradation of two different azo dyes in bioelectrochemical systems
PY  - 2015
AB  - A comparative study on the degradation of acid navy blue R (ANB) and reactive orange 16 (RO 16) was performed in two identical microbial fuel cells (MFCs) under similar conditions and the microbial communities were quantified using a quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Electricity and methane gas were produced as the end products along with the significant removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) during the study. The overall performance in terms of degradation rate, COD removal efficiency and biogas production rates were slightly better in the case of the reactor using RO 16 as the carbon source, while electricity production was slightly greater in the reactor treating ANB. A negative standard reduction potential of the reaction mixture indicates the presence of oxidized species in the reactor. Scanning electron microscopy images show the presence of diatoms and rod shaped bacteria in the mixed microbial culture and also confirmed the formation of a biofilm on the anode surface. The qPCR technique was used as a quantitative tool to estimate the abundance of methanogens, sulphate reducing bacteria (SRBs) and electrochemically active Geobacter species. The relative abundance of methanogens was comparatively higher and Geobacter was lower in the case of the reactor treating RO 16. Although the output power was low, this technique can be used for the effective degradation of complex and toxic compounds.

TI  - Bioremediation and Electricity Generation by Using Open and Closed Sediment Microbial Fuel Cells.
PY  - 2019
AB  - The industrial contamination of marine sediments with mercury, silver, and zinc in Penang, Malaysia was studied with bio-remediation coupled with power generation using membrane less open (aerated) and closed (non-aerated) sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs). The prototype for this SMFC is very similar to a natural aquatic environment because it is not stimulated externally and an oxygen sparger is inserted in the cathode chamber to create the aerobic environment in the open SMFC and no oxygen supplied in the closed SMFC. The open and closed SMFCs were showed the maximum voltage generation 300.5 mV (77.75 mW/m2) and 202.7 mV (45.04 (mW/m2), respectively. The cyclic voltammetry showed the oxidation peak in open SMFCs at +1.9 μA and reduction peak at -0.3 μA but in closed SMFCs oxidation and reduction peaks were noted at +1.5 μA and -1.0 μA, respectively. The overall impedance (anode, cathode and solution) of closed SMFCs was higher than open SMFCs. The charge transfer impedance showed that the rates of substrate oxidation and reduction were very low in the closed SMFCs than open SMFCs. The Nyquist arc indicated that O2 act as electron acceptor in the open SMFCs and CO2 in the closed SMFCs. The highest remediation efficiency of toxic metals [Hg (II) ions, Zn (II) ions, and Ag (I) ions] in the open SMFCs were 95.03%, 86.69%, and 83.65% in closed SMFCs were 69.53%, 66.57%, and 65.33%, respectively, observed during 60-80 days. The scanning electron microscope and 16S rRNA analysis showed diverse exoelectrogenic community in the open SMFCs and closed SMFCs. The results demonstrated that open SMFCs could be employed for the power generation and bioremediation of pollutants.

TI  - Applications of Graphene-Modified Electrodes in Microbial Fuel Cells
PY  - 2016
AB  - Graphene-modified materials have captured increasing attention for energy applications due to their superior physical and chemical properties, which can significantly enhance the electricity generation performance of microbial fuel cells (MFC). In this review, several typical synthesis methods of graphene-modified electrodes, such as graphite oxide reduction methods, self-assembly methods, and chemical vapor deposition, are summarized. According to the different functions of the graphene-modified materials in the MFC anode and cathode chambers, a series of design concepts for MFC electrodes are assembled, e.g., enhancing the biocompatibility and improving the extracellular electron transfer efficiency for anode electrodes and increasing the active sites and strengthening the reduction pathway for cathode electrodes. In spite of the challenges of MFC electrodes, graphene-modified electrodes are promising for MFC development to address the reduction in efficiency brought about by organic waste by converting it into electrical energy.

TI  - Electrically conductive polymers and composites for biomedical applications
PY  - 2015
AB  - Electrically conductive polymeric materials have recently attracted considerable interest from academic and industrial researchers to explore their potential in biomedical applications such as in biosensors, drug delivery systems, biomedical implants and tissue engineering. Conventional conductive homopolymers such as polypyrrole and PEDOT show promising conductivity for these applications, however their mechanical properties, biocompatibility and processability are often poor. This has led to more recent attention being directed towards conductive polymeric composites comprised of biostable/biocompatible polymers with dispersed conductive fillers such as graphene, carbon nanotubes and metallic nanoparticles. The major objective of this paper is to provide an up to date review of the recent investigations conducted in the development of conductive polymer composites focussing on the methods of their preparation, underlying concepts of their conductivity and the ways to tailor their properties. Furthermore, recent progress made in conventional conducting polymers and their composites/blends for biomedical applications is also discussed.

TI  - Open air biocathode enables effective electricity generation with microbial fuel cells
PY  - 2007
AB  - The reduction of oxygen at the cathode is one of the major bottlenecks of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). While research so far has mainly focused on chemical catalysis of this oxygen reduction, here we present a continuously wetted cathode with microorganisms that act as biocatalysts for oxygen reduction. We combined the anode of an acetate oxidizing tubular microbial fuel cell with an open air biocathode for electricity production. The maximum power production was 83 11 W m(-3) MFC (0.183 L MFC) for batchfed systems (20-40% Coulombic yield) and 65 5 W m(-3) MFC for a continuous system with an acetate loading rate of 1.5 kg COD m(-3) day(-1) (90 +/- 3% Coulombic yield). Electrochemical precipitation of manganese oxides on the cathodic graphite felt decreased the start-up period with approximately 30% versus a non-treated graphite felt. After the start-up period, the cell performance was similar for the pretreated and non-treated cathodic electrodes. Several reactor designs were tested, and it was found that enlargement of the 0.183 L MFC reactor by a factor 2.9-3.8 reduced the volumetric power output by 60-67%. Biocathodes alleviate the need to use noble or non-noble catalysts for the reduction of oxygen, which increases substantially the viability and sustainability of MFCs.

TI  - Electrochemical Behavior of Anode-Respiring Bacteria on Doped Carbon Electrodes.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Cultivating anodic respiring bacteria (ARB) on anodes doped with metal-enhanced biological growth and affected higher electocatalytic activity (ECA). The anode doped with calcium sulfide (CaS) proved more favorable for ARB than the magnetite (Fe3O4) or iron(II) sulfide (FeS). Average anodic current densities of 8.4 Am2– (Fe3O4), 11.1 Am2– (FeS), and 22.0 Am2– (CaS) were achieved as compared to that of nondoped carbon (5.1 A m–2). Thus, CaS-doped graphite represents a promising anode material which is suitable for highly efficient bioelectrochemical systems (BES). Electrochemical evaluation during turnover and starvation using simple cycle voltammetry (CV) and derivative cycle voltammetry (DCV) indicated several extracellular electron transfer (EET) pathways characterized with lower potentials for biofilms. However, despite the high affinity of bacteria to iron, their lower ECA was kinetically attributed to the accumulation of self-produced mediators on iron-doped anodes.

TI  - Design of Iron(II) Phthalocyanine-Derived Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysts for High-Power-Density Microbial Fuel Cells.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Iron(II) Phthalocyanine (FePc) deposited onto two different carbonaceous supports was synthesized by the non-conventional pyrolysis-free method, studied in the reaction of oxygen reduction (ORR) in neutral media, incorporated in an air-breathing cathode structure and tested in operating microbial fuel cell (MFC) configuration. Rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE) analysis revealed high performances of the Fe-based catalysts compared with activated carbon (AC). It was shown that Black Pearls supported FePc (Fe-BP(N)) exhibits the highest performance in term of more positive onset, positive shift of half-wave potential and higher limiting as well as highest power density in operating MFC (243±7 μWcm-2) that was 33% higher than Fe-CNT(N) (182±5 μWcm-2). Power density generated by Fe-BP(N) was 92% higher than AC indicating that the utilization of PGM-free catalysts can boost up significantly the performances of MFCs.

TI  - Field and temperature dependence of intrinsic diamagnetism in graphene: Theory and experiment
PY  - 2015
AB  - Intrinsic diamagnetism of graphene is studied both theoretically and experimentally, to unravel the magnetic response of chiral massless fermions. Comprehensive formulas predicting the variation of graphene magnetization with magnetic field and temperature are developed. Graphene magnetization $M$ at low temperatures is particularly large and $M\ensuremath{\propto}\ensuremath{-}\sqrt{B}$, intrinsically different from normal materials. The quantum Berry phase of $\ensuremath{\pi}$ and linear energy dispersion are responsible for this intriguing macroscopic behavior. The temperature dependence of magnetization is successfully formulated by a Langevin-like function. The de Haas--van Alphen oscillations are predicted in the case of doping. Correspondingly, experiments at different temperatures are conducted on highly pure, mass-produced graphene flakes derived from SiC single crystals, which exhibit very strong diamagnetism. The measured results agree well with the theoretical ones in both magnitude and trend.

TI  - Enhanced Performance of Hexavalent Chromium Reducing Cathodes in the Presence of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 and Lactate
PY  - 2013
AB  - Biocathodes for the reduction of the highly toxic hexavalent chromium (Cr(VI)) were investigated using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (MR-1) as a biocatalyst and performance was assessed in terms of current production and Cr(VI) reduction. Potentiostatically controlled experiments (-500 mV vs Ag/AgCl) showed that a mediatorless MR-1 biocathode started up under aerated conditions in the presence of lactate, received 5.5 and 1.7 times more electrons for Cr(VI) reduction over a 4 h operating period than controls without lactate and with lactate but without MR-1, respectively. Cr(VI) reduction was also enhanced, with a decrease in concentration over the 4 h operating period of 9 mg/L Cr(VI), compared to only 1 and 3 mg/L, respectively, in the controls. Riboflavin, an electron shuttle mediator naturally produced by MR-1, was also found to have a positive impact in potentiostatically controlled cathodes. Additionally, a microbial fuel cell (MFC) with MR-1 and lactate present in both anode and cathode produced a maximum current density of 32.5 mA/m(2) (1000 Ω external load) after receiving a 10 mg/L Cr(VI) addition in the cathode, and cathodic efficiency increased steadily over an 8 day operation period with successive Cr(VI) additions. In conclusion, effective and continuous Cr(VI) reduction with associated current production were achieved when MR-1 and lactate were both present in the biocathodes.

TI  - Graphene oxide/carbon nanotube composite hydrogels-versatile materials for microbial fuel cell applications.
PY  - 2014
AB  - Carbonaceous nanocomposite hydrogels are prepared with an aid of a suspension polymerization method and are used as anodes in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). (Poly N-Isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) hydrogels filled with electrically conductive carbonaceous nanomaterials exhibit significantly higher MFC efficiencies than the unfilled hydrogel. The observed morphological images clearly show the homogeneous dispersion of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene oxide (GO) in the PNIPAM matrix. The complex formation of CNTs and GO with NIPAM is evidenced from the structural characterizations. The effectual MFC performances are influenced by combining the materials of interest (GO and CNTs) and are attributed to the high surface area, number of active sites, and improved electron-transfer processes. The obtained higher MFC efficiencies associated with an excellent durability of the prepared hydrogels open up new possibilities for MFC anode applications.

TI  - Continuous bioelectricity production and sustainable wastewater treatment in a microbial fuel cell constructed with non-catalyzed granular graphite electrodes and permeable membrane.
PY  - 2010
AB  - Oxygen has been so far addressed as the most preferable terminal electron acceptor in the cathodes of microbial fuel cells (MFCs). However, to reduce the oxygen reduction overpotential at the cathode surface, eco-unfriendly and costly catalysts have been commonly employed. Here, we pursued the possibility of using a high surface area electrode to reduce the cathodic reaction overpotential rather than the utilization of catalyzed materials. A dual chambered MFC reactor was designed with the use of graphite-granule electrodes and a permeable membrane. The performance of the reactor in terms of electricity generation and organic removal rate was examined under a continuous-feed manner. Results showed that the maximum volumetric power of 4.4 ± 0.2 W/m 3 net anodic compartment (NAC) was obtained at a current density of 1 1 ± 0.5A/m 3 NAC. The power output was improved by increasing the electrolyte ionic strength. An acceptable effluent quality was attained when the organic loading rate (OLR) of 2 kgCOD/m 3 NAC d was applied. The organic removal rate seemed to be less affected by shock loading. Our system can be suggested as a promising approach to make MFC-based technology economically viable for wastewater treatment applications. This study shows that current generation can be remarkably improved in comparison with several other studies using a low-surface-area plain graphite electrode.

TI  - Electrochemistry and microbiology of microbial fuel cells treating marine sediments polluted with heavy metals
PY  - 2018
AB  - The industrial contamination of marine sediments with chromium, copper and nickel in Penang, Malaysia was addressed with bio-remediation, coupled with power generation, using in situ sediment microbial cells (SMFCs) under various conditions. The efficiency of aerated sediment microbial fuel cells (A-SMFCs) and non-aerated sediment microbial fuel cells (NA-SMFCs) was studied. The A-SMFCs generated a voltage of 580.5 mV between 50 and 60 days, while NA-SMFCs produced a voltage of 510 mV between 60 and 80 days. The cell design point for A-SMFCs was 2 kΩ, while for NA-SMFCs it was 200 Ω. In both SMFCs, the maximum current values relating to forward scanning, reverse scanning and oxidation/reduction peaks were recorded on the 80th day. The anode showed maximum additional capacitance on the 80th day (A-SMFC: 2.7 F cm−2; and NA-SMFC: 2.2 F cm−2). The whole cell electrochemical impedance using the Nyquist model was 21 Ω for A-SMFCs and 15 Ω for NA-SMFCs. After glucose enrichment, the impedance of A-SMFCs was 24.3 Ω and 14.6 Ω for NA-SMFCs. After 60 days, the A-SMFCs reduced the maximum amount of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) ions (80.70%) and Cu(II) to Cu(I) ions (72.72%), and showed maximum intracellular uptake of Ni(II) ions (80.37%); the optimum remediation efficiency of NA-SMFCs was after 80 days toward Cr(VI) ions (67.36%), Cu(II) ions (59.36%) and Ni(II) ions (52.74%). Both SMFCs showed highest heavy metal reduction and power generation at a pH of 7.0. SEM images and 16S rRNA gene analysis showed a diverse bacterial community in both A-SMFCs and NA-SMFCs. The performance of A-SMFCs showed that they could be exercised as durable and efficient technology for power production and the detoxification of heavy metal sediments. The NA-SMFCs could also be employed where anaerobic fermentation is required.

TI  - Role of Nanomaterials in the Treatment of Wastewater: A Review
PY  - 2020
AB  - Water is an essential part of life and its availability is important for all living creatures. On the other side, the world is suffering from a major problem of drinking water. There are several gases, microorganisms and other toxins (chemicals and heavy metals) added into water during rain, flowing water, etc. which is responsible for water pollution. This review article describes various applications of nanomaterial in removing different types of impurities from polluted water. There are various kinds of nanomaterials, which carried huge potential to treat polluted water (containing metal toxin substance, different organic and inorganic impurities) very effectively due to their unique properties like greater surface area, able to work at low concentration, etc. The nanostructured catalytic membranes, nanosorbents and nanophotocatalyst based approaches to remove pollutants from wastewater are eco-friendly and efficient, but they require more energy, more investment in order to purify the wastewater. There are many challenges and issues of wastewater treatment. Some precautions are also required to keep away from ecological and health issues. New modern equipment for wastewater treatment should be flexible, low cost and efficient for the commercialization purpose.

TI  - Dual-Function Electrocatalytic and Macroporous Hollow-Fiber Cathode for Converting Waste Streams to Valuable Resources Using Microbial Electrochemical Systems.
PY  - 2018
AB  - Dual-function electrocatalytic and macroporous hollow-fiber cathodes are recently proposed as promising advanced material for maximizing the conversion of waste streams such as wastewater and waste CO2 to valuable resources (e.g., clean freshwater, energy, value-added chemicals) in microbial electrochemical systems. The first part of this progress report reviews recent developments in this type of cathode architecture for the simultaneous recovery of clean freshwater and energy from wastewater. Critical insights are provided on suitable materials for fabricating these cathodes, as well as addressing some challenges in the fabrication process with proposed strategies to overcome them. The second and complementary part of the progress report highlights how the unique features of this cathode architecture can solve one of the intrinsic bottlenecks (gas-liquid mass transfer limitation) in the application of microbial electrochemical systems for CO2 reduction to value-added products. Strategies to further improve the availability of CO2 to microbial catalysts on the cathode are proposed. The importance of understanding microbe-cathode interactions, as well as electron transfer mechanisms at the cathode-cell and cell-cell interface to better design dual-function macroporous hollow-fiber cathodes, is critically discussed with insights on how the choice of material is important in facilitating direct electron transfer versus mediated electron transfer.

TI  - Microbial Communities and Electrochemical Performance of Titanium-Based Anodic Electrodes in a Microbial Fuel Cell
PY  - 2010
AB  - Four types of titanium (Ti)-based electrodes were tested in the same microbial fuel cell (MFC) anodic compartment. Their electrochemical performances and the dominant microbial communities of the electrode biofilms were compared. The electrodes were identical in shape, macroscopic surface area, and core material but differed in either surface coating (Pt- or Ta-coated metal composites) or surface texture (smooth or rough). The MFC was inoculated with electrochemically active, neutrophilic microorganisms that had been enriched in the anodic compartments of acetate-fed MFCs over a period of 4 years. The original inoculum consisted of bioreactor sludge samples amended with Geobacter sulfurreducens strain PCA. Overall, the Pt- and Ta-coated Ti bioanodes (electrode-biofilm association) showed higher current production than the uncoated Ti bioanodes. Analyses of extracted DNA of the anodic liquid and the Pt- and Ta-coated Ti electrode biofilms indicated differences in the dominant bacterial communities. Biofilm formation on the uncoated electrodes was poor and insufficient for further analyses. Bioanode samples from the Pt- and Ta-coated Ti electrodes incubated with Fe(III) and acetate showed several Fe(III)-reducing bacteria, of which selected species were dominant, on the surface of the electrodes. In contrast, nitrate-enriched samples showed less diversity, and the enriched strains were not dominant on the electrode surface. Isolated Fe(III)-reducing strains were phylogenetically related, but not all identical, to Geobacter sulfurreducens strain PCA. Other bacterial species were also detected in the system, such as a Propionicimonas-related species that was dominant in the anodic liquid and Pseudomonas-, Clostridium-, Desulfovibrio-, Azospira-, and Aeromonas-related species.

TI  - Graphene/Au composites as an anode modifier for improving electricity generation in Shewanella-inoculated microbial fuel cells
PY  - 2015
AB  - Electricity generation in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) greatly depends on anode materials, which directly affect bacterial attachment on the anode surface and extracellular electron transfer (ETT) between microorganisms and the electrode. Herein, graphene/Au (G/Au) composites were used as a novel anode material for Shewanella-inoculated MFCs. The current generation and power density of the MFCs with a G/Au modified carbon paper (CP/G/Au) anode were significantly improved compared with a conventional carbon paper (CP) anode. This could be attributed to its large surface area, excellent conductivity and good biocompatibility for enhanced bacterial loading on the anode surface and improved EET efficiency between the microbe and the electrode.

TI  - Conductive “Smart” Hybrid Hydrogels with PNIPAM and Nanostructured Conductive Polymers
PY  - 2015
AB  - Stimuli-responsive hydrogels with decent electrical properties are a promising class of polymeric materials for a range of technological applications, such as electrical, electrochemical, and biomedical devices. In this paper, thermally responsive and conductive hybrid hydrogels are synthesized by in situ formation of continuous network of conductive polymer hydrogels crosslinked by phytic acid in poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) matrix. The interpenetrating binary network structure provides the hybrid hydrogels with continuous transporting path for electrons, highly porous microstructure, strong interactions between two hydrogel networks, thus endowing the hybrid hydrogels with a unique combination of high electrical conductivity (up to 0.8 S m−1), high thermoresponsive sensitivity (significant volume change within several seconds), and greatly enhanced mechanical properties. This work demonstrates that the architecture of the filling phase in the hydrogel matrix and design of hybrid hydrogel structure play an important role in determining the performance of the resulting hybrid material. The attractive performance of these hybrid hydrogels is further demonstrated by the developed switcher device which suggests potential applications in stimuli-responsive electronic devices.

TI  - Immobilization of a Metal–Nitrogen–Carbon Catalyst on Activated Carbon with Enhanced Cathode Performance in Microbial Fuel Cells
PY  - 2016
AB  - Applications of microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are limited in part by low power densities mainly due to cathode performance. Successful immobilization of an Fe-N-C co-catalyst on activated carbon (Fe-N-C/AC) improved the oxygen reduction reaction to nearly a four-electron transfer, compared to a twoelectron transfer achieved using AC. With acetate as the fuel, the maximum power density was 4.7±0.2 W m(-2) , which is higher than any previous report for an air-cathode MFC. With domestic wastewater as a fuel, MFCs with the Fe-N-C/AC cathode produced up to 0.8±0.03 W m(-2) , which was twice that obtained with a Pt-catalyzed cathode. The use of this Fe-N-C/AC catalyst can therefore substantially increase power production, and enable broader applications of MFCs for renewable electricity generation using waste materials.

TI  - Assessment of Microbial Fuel Cell Configurations and Power Densities
PY  - 2015
AB  - Different microbial electrochemical technologies are being developed for many diverse applications, including wastewater treatment, biofuel production, water desalination, remote power sources, and biosensors. Current and energy densities will always be limited relative to batteries and chemical fuel cells, but these technologies have other advantages based on the self-sustaining nature of the microorganisms that can donate or accept electrons from an electrode, the range of fuels that can be used, and versatility in the chemicals that can be produced. The high cost of membranes will likely limit applications of microbial electrochemical technologies that might require a membrane. For microbial fuel cells, which do not need a membrane, questions about whether larger-scale systems can produce power densities similar to those obtained in laboratory-scale systems remain. It is shown here that configuration and fuel (pure chemicals in laboratory media vs actual wastewaters) remain the key factors in power pro...

TI  - Synthesis, Structural, and Morphological Characterizations of Reduced Graphene Oxide-Supported Polypyrrole Anode Catalysts for Improved Microbial Fuel Cell Performances
PY  - 2014
AB  - The conductive polypyrrole (PPy)/reduced graphene oxide (rGO) composites were synthesized through simple, environmentally benign, time and cost efficient, in situ polymerization and bioreduction techniques. The pyrrole monomer effectively adsorbed over the negatively charged GO sheets through electrostatic and π–π interactions was polymerized into polypyrrole in its adsorbed state. The obtained morphological images of the rGO/PPy composite ensured that the entire surface of the active carbon support was covered by PPy. The removal of oxygen functionalities from GO with the aid of Ocimum tenuiflorum extract was ascertained through FT-IR and UV–vis absorption spectroscopic studies. The rGO/PPy composite exhibited higher electrocatalytic oxidation current as evidenced from the cyclic voltammetric analysis. The number of actives sites and continuous carrier channels of the rGO/PPy composite exhibited a maximum MFC power density of 1068 mW/m2, which is almost two-fold higher than that of bare PPy. The strong a...

TI  - Mechanical properties of nickel-graphene composites synthesized by electrochemical deposition.
PY  - 2015
AB  - Graphene (Gr) nanosheets with multilayer structures were dispersed in a nickel (Ni) plating solution by using a surfactant with a magnetic stirring method. Gr nanosheets were incorporated into a Ni matrix through a plating process to form Ni-Gr composites on a target substrate. Gr nanosheets were uniformly dispersed in the Ni matrix, and the oxygen radicals present in the Gr were reduced during the electro-deposition process. The incorporation of Gr in the Ni matrix increases both the inter-planar spacing and the degree of preferred orientation of crystalline Ni. With the addition of Gr content as low as 0.05 g L−1, the elastic modulus and hardness of the Ni-Gr composites reach 240 GPa and 4.6 GPa, respectively, which are about 1.7 and 1.2 times that of the pure Ni deposited under the same condition. The enhancement in mechanical properties of the composites is attributed to the preferred formation of the Ni crystalline phases in its (111) plane, the high interaction between Ni and Gr and the prevention of the dislocation sliding in the Ni matrix by the Gr. The results suggest that the method of using Gr directly instead of graphene oxide (GO) is efficient and scalable.

TI  - Progress and Status of Hydrometallurgical and Direct Recycling of Li-Ion Batteries and Beyond.
PY  - 2020
AB  - An exponential market growth of Li-ion batteries (LIBs) has been observed in the past 20 years; approximately 670,000 tons of LIBs have been sold in 2017 alone. This trend will continue owing to the growing interest of consumers for electric vehicles, recent engagement of car manufacturers to produce them, recent developments in energy storage facilities, and commitment of governments for the electrification of transportation. Although some limited recycling processes were developed earlier after the commercialization of LIBs, these are inadequate in the context of sustainable development. Therefore, significant efforts have been made to replace the commonly employed pyrometallurgical recycling method with a less detrimental approach, such as hydrometallurgical, in particular sulfate-based leaching, or direct recycling. Sulfate-based leaching is the only large-scale hydrometallurgical method currently used for recycling LIBs and serves as baseline for several pilot or demonstration projects currently under development. Conversely, most project and processes focus only on the recovery of Ni, Co, Mn, and less Li, and are wasting the iron phosphate originating from lithium iron phosphate (LFP) batteries. Although this battery type does not dominate the LIB market, its presence in the waste stream of LIBs causes some technical concerns that affect the profitability of current recycling processes. This review explores the current processes and alternative solutions to pyrometallurgy, including novel selective leaching processes or direct recycling approaches.

TI  - Microbial fuel cells: Advances in electrode modifications for improvement of system performance
PY  - 2017
AB  - ABSTRACTThere is an increasing trend to conduct the researches related to Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) in the recent years. Limited power output has been the major obstacle for the practical application and upscaling of MFCs. Attempts have been made on electrode modifications such as anode treatments, cathode modifications with catalysts and bio cathodes developments to produce varying degrees of improved output current depending upon the types of modifications. Power density and Coulombic efficiency have been considered as the important parameters to analyze the system performances. This paper overviews on the advances made in MFCs’ researches focusing on different types of electrodes modifications along with the involved methodology. Furthermore, the system performances of different modified MFCs are compared in terms of the power density and the Coulombic efficiency.

TI  - Graphene and Polymer Composites for Supercapacitor Applications: a Review
PY  - 2017
AB  - Supercapacitors, as one of the energy storage devices, exhibit ultrahigh capacitance, high power density, and long cycle. High specific surface area, mechanical and chemical stability, and low cost are often required for supercapacitor materials. Graphene, as a new emerging carbon material, has attracted a lot of attention in energy storage field due to its intrinsic properties. Polymers are often incorporated into graphene for a number of enhanced or new properties as supercapacitors. In this paper, different polymers which are used to form composite materials for supercapacitor applications are reviewed. The functions, strategies, and the enhanced properties of graphene and polymer composites are discussed. Finally, the recent development of graphene and polymers for flexible supercapacitors are also discussed.

TI  - High-Thermal- and Air-Stability Cathode Material with Concentration-Gradient Buffer for Li-Ion Batteries.
PY  - 2017
AB  - Delivery of high capacity with high thermal and air stability is a great challenge in the development of Ni-rich layered cathodes for commercialized Li-ion batteries (LIBs). Herein we present a surface concentration-gradient spherical particle with varying elemental composition from the outer end LiNi1/3Co1/3Mn1/3O2 (NCM) to the inner end LiNi0.8Co0.15Al0.05O2 (NCA). This cathode material with the merit of NCM concentration-gradient protective buffer and the inner NCA core shows high capacity retention of 99.8% after 200 cycles at 0.5 C. Furthermore, this cathode material exhibits much improved thermal and air stability compared with bare NCA. These results provide new insights into the structural design of high-performance cathodes with high energy density, long life span, and storage stability materials for LIBs in the future.

TI  - Application of UV-Based Advanced Oxidation Processes in Water and Wastewater Treatment
PY  - 2019
AB  - <jats:p>The presence of hazardous micropollutants in water and wastewater is one of the main concerns in water management system. This micropollutant exists in a low concentration, but there are possible hazards to humans and organisms living in the water. Moreover, its character that is recalcitrant to microbiological degradation makes it difficult to deal with. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are efficient methods to remove low concentration micropollutants. AOPs are a set of processes consisting the production of very reactive oxygen species which able to destroy a wide range of organic compounds. The main principal mechanism in UV-based radical AOP treatment processes is the use ultraviolet light to initiate generation of hydroxyl radicals used to destroy persistent organic pollutants. Therefore, this chapter presents an overview on the principle of radical oxidant species generation and degradation mechanism by various type of UV based AOP in treating contaminants present in water and wastewater. The current application and possible improvement of the technology is also presented in this chapter.</jats:p>

TI  - Application of Nano-Electrode Platinum (Pt) and Nano-Wire Titanium (Ti) for Increasing Electrical Energy Generation in Microbial Fuel Cells of Synthetic Wastewater with Carbon Source (Acetate)
PY  - 2014
AB  - The microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are a kind of systems through which the anaerobic bacteriaalong with the oxidation of simple or complicated organic matter in the wastewater can generate the electricpower. This is a modern approach used in generation of the clean and renewable energy. In this research, two pilot laboratories of double-chamber microbial fuel cells were made. One of them contained platinum electrode and simple nano-wire Titanium and the other had nano-electrode Platinum and nano-wire with equal volume of 1 liter. They were launched in 4 Hydraulic Retention Time (2.5, 3.5, 4.5 and 5.5 hrs.) and increased in 4 steps of organic loading rate with synthetic wastewater with carbon source (acetate) and temperature (20±5°C). The voltage and electric current was measured by means of digital multimetre. The performance of the two reactors in generation of electricity was investigated based on the polarization curve. Maximum voltage and current output were, respectively, 1425 mV and 13.1 mA, and the maximum power density and current density were, respectively 78 mW/m2 and 67.3 mA/m2 and columbic efficiency were achieved in 34.6% in mreactor with nano-electrode Platinum and nano-wire Titanium (in HRT 4.5 hr and external resistance was 100Ω). In addition, the maximum removal rate of COD in organic loading rate 3.99 Kg COD/m3.day is equal to 98.28% for nano-electric and nano-wire and 72.5% for simple electrode and wire.

TI  - Non-PGM membrane electrode assemblies: Optimization for performance
PY  - 2015
AB  - Abstract The performance of non-platinum group metals (non-PGM) iron–nitrogen–carbon (Fe–N–C) based cathode in fuel cell operation conditions was studied. The effect of Nafion to catalyst ratio as well as carbon additives on the activity was studied. It was found that ionomer plays a key role in proton and water transport within the MEA. To compensate intrinsic low electronic conductivity of Fe–N–C materials additional carbons such as Vulcan XC72R, Ketjen Black 600 EC, and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) were added to MEA inks. X-ray Phototelectron Spectroscopy studied the effect of these carbon additives on chemical composition of catalysts. It was determined that inks with 35 wt% of Nafion ionomer resulted in the optimal performance of the Fe–N–C cathode catalyst in the air.

TI  - High Performance Platinum Group Metal-Free Cathode Catalysts for Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC)
PY  - 2016
AB  - © The Author(s) 2016. The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) at the cathode is usually the limiting step in microbial fuel cells and improvements have to be done to increase the performances and reduce the cost. For the first time, iron-based catalysts were synthesized utilizing the polymerization-pyrolysis method and tested successfully in neutral media and in working microbial fuel cells (MFCs). The catalysts were synthesized using polymerization, salt formation, mixed with iron salt and pyrolyzed at 850°C (PABA-850) and 950°C (PABA- 950) respectively. To study the kinetics, electro-activity of the catalysts was investigated using rotating ring disk electrode (RRDE). Results showed that PABA-850 had higher catalytic activity compared to that of PABA-950. Both Fe-catalysts had much better activity compared to activated carbon (AC) used as a baseline. Catalysts were then integrated into air breathing cathodes (loading 1 mg cm-2) and tested in single chamber MFC. The power peak obtained was 178 ± 3 μWcm-2 for PABA-850. Comparable power was produced from PABA-950 (173 ± 3 μWcm-2). AC power output was 131 ± 4 μWcm-2 that was roughly 40% lower compared to Fe-based catalysts. Those results demonstrated that the addition of platinum group metal free (PGM-free) catalysts increased the output of the MFCs substantially. Fe-based catalysts seem to be suitable for large-scale MFC applications.

TI  - Progress in Rechargeable Aqueous Zinc- and Aluminum-Ion Battery Electrodes: Challenges and Outlook
PY  - 2018
AB  - <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Modern cities demand a reliable supply of electricity when and where it is needed, therefore a key design for power generators feeding on noncontinuous, nonfuel renewables is installing auxiliary battery‐type energy storage systems (BESS). Batteries using Zn ions or Al ions in aqueous electrolytes are highly attractive due to low cost and elemental abundance considerations, but attaining reversibility at a high energy density and long‐life operation is challenging. Here, the authors review recent reports of reversible aqueous‐electrolyte batteries, focusing on how mechanisms of electrochemical activation, insertion, and conversion occur. Further, key issues related to cation mobility, electrode stability, the formation of electrode–electrolyte interface, and electrolyte decomposition, along with possible solutions or research directions for enabling superior performance of aqueous Zn‐ion batteries and Al‐ion batteries are explored.</jats:p>

TI  - A monolithic three-dimensional macroporous graphene anode with low cost for high performance microbial fuel cells
PY  - 2016
AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs), capable of simultaneously degrading substrates and producing bioelectricity, have drawn great attention. However, low power output and high cost have severely hindered their practical application. The present study prepared a monolithic three-dimensional graphene (3D-G) electrode through a self-assembly method. The as-prepared 3D-G electrode featured inflexibility, a crumpled surface, a macroporous structure (with pore spaces of dozens of microns), high specific surface area (188.32 m2 g−1), good conductivity and low cost, favoring high bacterial loading capacity and enhancing the extracellular electron transfer (EET) efficiency. Equipped with the prepared 3D-G anode in an air-cathode single chamber MFC reactor, the maximum power density (Pmax) increased to 1516 ± 87 mW m−2 in the 3D-G reactor from 877 ± 57 mW m−2 in the graphite felt (GF) control and from 584 ± 39 mW m−2 in the carbon cloth (CC) control after 2 weeks of operation. Moreover, the Pmax of the reactor with the 3D-G anode decreased only by 15% after 2 months of operation, which showed durability of the anode due to having macropores which are not easily blocked. Normalized to the cost of the anode, the Pmax in the 3D-G reactor was 93 and 133 times those in the GF and CC reactors, respectively. Dynamic analysis results (CV, Tafel and EIS) showed that the 3D-G anode improved the efficiency of EET due to having an appropriate structure and good conductivity. The 3D-G anode, with superior performance and low cost, would powerfully promote the practical and large-scale application of MFCs.

AC was cold-pressed with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) binder to form the cathode around a Ni mesh current collector. This cathode construction avoided the need for carbon cloth or a metal catalyst, and produced a cathode with high activity for oxygen reduction at typical MFC current densities. Tests with the AC cathode produced a maximum power density of 1220 mW/m 2 (normalized to cathode projected surface area; 36 W/m 3 based on liquid volume) compared to 1060 mW/m 2 obtained by Pt catalyzed carbon cloth cathode. The Coulombic efficiency ranged from 15% to 55%. These findings show that AC is a cost-effective material for achieving useful rates of oxygen reduction in air cathode MFCs.

TI  - Performance improvement of microbial fuel cell (MFC) using suitable electrode and Bioengineered organisms: A review.
PY  - 2017
AB  - There is an urgent need to find an environment friendly and sustainable technology for alternative energy due to rapid depletion of fossil fuel and industrialization. Microbial Fuel Cells (MFCs) have operational and functional advantages over the current technologies for energy generation from organic matter as it directly converts electricity from substrate at ambient temperature. However, MFCs are still unsuitable for high energy demands due to practical limitations. The overall performance of an MFC depends on microorganism, appropriate electrode materials, suitable MFC designs, and optimizing process parameters which would accelerate commercialization of this technology in near future. In this review, we put forth the recent developments on microorganism and electrode material that are critical for the generation of bioelectricity generation. This would give a comprehensive insight into the characteristics, options, modifications, and evaluations of these parameters and their effects on process development of MFCs.

TI  - Performance and recent improvement in microbial fuel cells for simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal: A review.
PY  - 2016
AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) have become a promising technology for wastewater treatment accompanying electricity generation. Carbon and nitrogen removal can be achieved by utilizing the electron transfer between the anode and cathode in an MFC. However, large-scale power production and high removal efficiency must be achieved at a low cost to make MFCs practical and economically competitive in the future. This article reviews the principles, feasibility and bottlenecks of MFCs for simultaneous carbon and nitrogen removal, the recent advances and prospective strategies for performance improvement, as well as the involved microbes and electron transfer mechanisms.

TI  - Power Generation and Electrochemical Analysis of Biocathode Microbial Fuel Cell Using Graphite Fibre Brush as Cathode Material
PY  - 2009
AB  - To improve cathodic efficiency and sustainability of microbial fuel cell (MFC), graphite fibre brush (GFB) was examined as cathode material for power production in biocatalysed-cathode MFC. Following 133-h mixed culturing of electricity-producing bacteria, the MFC could generate a reproducible voltage of 0.4 V at external resistance (REX) of 100 Ω. Maximum volumetric power density of 68.4 W m–3 was obtained at a current density of 178.6 A m–3. Upon aerobic inoculation of electrochemically active bacteria, charge transfer resistance of the cathode was decreased from 188 to 17 Ω as indicated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) analysis. Comparing investigations of different cathode materials demonstrated that biocatalysed GFB had better performance in terms of half-cell polarisation, power and Coulombic efficiency (CE) over other tested materials. Additionally, pH deviation of electrolyte in anode and cathode was also observed. This study provides a demonstration of GFB used as biocathode material in MFC for more efficient and sustainable electricity recovery from organic substances.

TI  - Recovering platinum from wastewater by charring biofilm of microbial fuel cells (MFCs)
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Reduction in and recovery of precious metals are research hotspots in the environmental engineering field. In this study, we investigated the transformation and distribution of platinum in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) and demonstrated a feasible approach to recover platinum (Pt) from wastewater with less than 16.88 mg/L platinum through charring biofilms in MFCs and generate Pt/C catalyst. The optimal reaction condition was identified, and charred biofilms were analyzed via SEM-EDS, XRD and XPS. Results showed that less than 10% of Pt was in MFC effluents, and less than 0.5% was in the cathode chamber when the influent concentration was below 16.88 mg/L. Close to 40% of Pt could be recovered. The recovery efficiency could be higher should the reactions run longer. SEM-EDS and XRD results indicated that the metallic form Pt0 is one of the reduction products in MFCs. XPS results induced that Pt (IV) was reduced to Pt (II) and Pt0.

TI  - A review on graphene–TiO2 and doped graphene–TiO2 nanocomposite photocatalyst for water and wastewater treatment
PY  - 2016
AB  - ABSTRACTTiO2 is a more effective photocatalyst for the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants. However it shows more reactivity under UV light and around 5% of solar spectrum contains UV radiations. A new approach for the degradation of pollutants present in wastewater is suggested by making use of nanocomposite photocatalysts. The technique has potential for the treatment of wastewater because of the use of doped graphene-based nanocomposite photocatalysts. Graphene is a one-atom-thick planar sheet of sp2-bonded carbon atoms that are densely packed in a honeycomb crystal lattice. Furthermore, graphene has high electron mobility and therefore it will supress the recombination of the electron-hole pair formed which in turn improves the effectiveness of the graphene-TiO2 photocatalyst. In addition, development of doped graphene-TiO2 photocatalyst will be useful as it can be effective for the degradation of pollutants in the visible sunlight. Recently, there has been an increase in interest in the ...

TI  - The impact of new cathode materials relative to baseline performance of microbial fuel cells all with the same architecture and solution chemistry
PY  - 2017
AB  - Differences in microbial fuel cell (MFC) architectures, materials, and solution chemistries, have previously hindered direct comparisons of improvements in power production due to new cathode materials. However, one common reactor design has now been used in many different laboratories around the world under similar operating conditions based on using: a graphite fiber brush anode, a platinum cathode catalyst, a single-chamber cube-shaped (4 cm) MFC with a 3 cm diameter anolyte chamber, 50 mM phosphate buffer, and an acetate fuel. Analysis of several publications over 10 years from a single laboratory showed that even under such identical operational conditions, maximum power densities varied by 15%, with an average of 1.36 ± 0.20 W m−2 (n = 24), normalized to cathode projected area (34 W m−3 liquid volume). In other laboratories, maximum power was significantly less, with an average of 0.91 ± 0.26 W m−2 (n = 10), despite identical conditions. One likely reason for the differences in power is cathode age. Power production with Pt catalyst cathodes significantly declined after one month of operation or more to 0.87 ± 0.31 W m−2 (n = 18) based on studies where cathode aging was examined, while in many studies the age of the cathode was not reported. Using these studies as a performance baseline, we review the claims of improvements in power generation due to new anode or cathode materials, or changes in solution conductivities and substrates.

TI  - Enzymatic Electrosynthesis: An Overview on the Progress in Enzyme- Electrodes for the Production of Electricity, Fuels and Chemicals
PY  - 2013
AB  - Recent interest in the field of biocommodities production through bioelectrochemical systems has generated interest in the enzyme catalyzed redox reactions. Enzyme catalyzed electrodes are well established as sensors and power generators. However, a paradigm shift in recent science towards the production of useful chemicals has changed the face of biofuel cells, keeping the fuels or chemicals production in the upfront. This review article comprehensively presents the progress in the field of enzyme-electrodes for the production of electricity, fuels and chemicals with an aim to represent a practical outline for understanding the use of single or multiple redox enzymes as electrocatalysts for their electron transfer onto electrodes. It also provides the state-of-the-art information regarding the different existing processes to fabricate enzyme electrodes. Successfully-achieved electroenzymatic anodic and cathodic reactions are further discussed, together with their potential applications. Particular focus was made on the novel single/multiple enzyme systems towards product synthesis and other applications. Finally, techno-economic and environmental elements for industrial processing with enzyme catalyzed bioelectrochemical system (e-BES) are anticipated, in order to provide useful strategies for further development of this technology.

TI  - A review on sediment microbial fuel cells as a new source of sustainable energy and heavy metal remediation: mechanisms and future prospective
PY  - 2017
AB  - Summary
Sediment microbial fuel cells (SMFCs) are different from microbial fuel cells because they are completely anoxic and lack a membrane. SMFCs are a novel technology for the simultaneous production of renewable energy and bioremediation of heavy metals. Recently, SMFCs have attracted the attention of many researchers because of their moderate functioning parameters and ability to use a range of biodegradable substrates like glucose, glutamic acid, river water, cysteine, acetate, and starch. The inocula used in SMFCs include river sediment, marine sediment, and wastewater. For power generation, many exoelectrogens in SMFCs have the ability to transfer electrons from electrodes by using natural electron shuttles. Exoelectrogens use four primary pathways to transfer electrons to the electrodes, including short-range electron transfer through redox-active proteins, soluble electron shuttling molecules, long-range electron transport by conductive pili, and direct interspecies electron transfer. The most dominant mechanism is long-range electron transfer via conductive pili because pili have metal-like conductivity. The powering by microbes is an emerging technique for the remediation of heavy metals from sediments. The pathways for transferring electrons in electrotrophs operate in the opposite direction from those in exoelectrogens. To further upgrade SMFC technology, this review targets the prototype, operating factors, working mechanisms, applications, and future perspectives of SMFCs. Copyright © 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

TI  - Single medium microbial fuel cell: Stainless steel and graphite electrode materials select bacterial communities resulting in opposite electrocatalytic activities
PY  - 2017
AB  - A graphite electrode and a stainless steel electrode immersed in exactly the same medium and polarised at the same potential were colonised by different microbial biofilms. This difference in electroactive microbial population leads stainless steel and graphite to become a microbial cathode and a microbial anode respectively. The results demonstrated that the electrode material can drive the electrocatalytic property of the biofilm opening perspectives for designing single medium MFC. This new discovery led to of the first demonstration of a “single medium MFC.” Such a single medium MFC designed with a graphite anode connected to a stainless steel cathode, both buried in marine sediments, produced 280 mA m−2 at a voltage of 0.3 V for more than 2 weeks.

TI  - Marine microbial fuel cell: Use of stainless steel electrodes as anode and cathode materials
PY  - 2007
AB  - Numerous biocorrosion studies have stated that biofilms formed in aerobic seawater induce an efficient catalysis of the oxygen reduction on stainless steels. This property was implemented here for the first time in a marine microbial fuel cell (MFC). A prototype was designed with a stainless steel anode embedded in marine sediments coupled to a stainless steel cathode in the overlying seawater. Recording current/potential curves during the progress of the experiment confirmed that the cathode progressively acquired effective catalytic properties. The maximal power density produced of 4 mW m −2 was lower than those reported previously with marine MFC using graphite electrodes. Decoupling anode and cathode showed that the cathode suffered practical problems related to implementation in the sea, which may found easy technical solutions. A laboratory fuel cell based on the same principle demonstrated that the biofilm-covered stainless steel cathode was able to supply current density up to 140 mA m −2 at +0.05 V versus Ag/AgCl. The power density of 23 mW m −2 was in this case limited by the anode. These first tests presented the biofilm-covered stainless steel cathodes as very promising candidates to be implemented in marine MFC. The suitability of stainless steel as anode has to be further investigated.

TI  - Scaling up microbial fuel cells.
PY  - 2008
AB  - The goal of this study was to quantify the relation between the surface area of the current-limiting electrode of a microbial fuel cell (MFC) and the power density generated by the MFC. Shewanella oneidensis (MR-1) was grown anaerobically in the anodic compartment of an MFC utilizing lactate as the electron donor. Graphite plate electrodes of various sizes were used as anodes. Commercially available air electrodes, composed of manganese-based catalyzed carbon bonded to a current-collecting screen made of platinum mesh, were used as cathodes, and dissolved oxygen was used as the cathodic reactant. The surface area of the cathode was always significantly larger than that of the anode, to ensure that the anode was the current-limiting electrode. The power density generated by the MFC decreased as the surface area of the anode increased, which fits well with the trend we detected comparing various published results. Thus, our findings bring into question the assertion that the overall power density generated ...

TI  - Decolorization of azo dyes in bioelectrochemical systems.
PY  - 2009
AB  - Azo dyes are ubiquitously used in the textile industry. These dyes need to be removed from the effluent prior to discharge to sewage due to their intense color and toxicity. In this study we investigated the use of a bioelectrochemical system (BES) to abioticlly cathodic decolorization of a model azo dye, Acid Orange 7 (AO7), where the process was driven by microbial oxidation of acetate atthe anode. Effective decolorization of AO7 at rates up to 264 +/- 0.03 mol m(-3) NCC d(-1) (net cathodic compartment, NCC) was achieved at the cathode, with concomitant energy recovery. The AO7 decolorization rate was significantly enhanced when the BES was supplied with power, reaching 13.18 +/- 0.05 mol m(-3) NCC d(-1) at an energy consumption 0.012 +/- 0.001 kWh mol(-1) AO7 (at a controlled cathode potential of -400 mV vs SHE). Compared with conventional anaerobic biological methods, the required dosage of organic cosubstrate was significantly reduced in the BES. A possible cathodic reaction mechanism for the decolorization of AO7 is suggested based on the decolorization products identified: the azo bond of AO7 was cleaved at the cathode, resulting in the formation of the colorless sulfanilic acid and 1-amino-2-naphthol.

TI  - Microbial fuel cells: An overview of current technology
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Research into alternative renewable energy generation is a priority, due to the ever-increasing concern of climate change. Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are one potential avenue to be explored, as a partial solution towards combating the over-reliance on fossil fuel based electricity. Limitations have slowed the advancement of MFC development, including low power generation, expensive electrode materials and the inability to scale up MFCs to industrially relevant capacities. However, utilisation of new advanced electrode-materials (i.e. 2D nanomaterials), has promise to advance the field of electromicrobiology. New electrode materials coupled with a more thorough understanding of the mechanisms in which electrogenic bacteria partake in electron transfer could dramatically increase power outputs, potentially reaching the upper extremities of theoretical limits. Continued research into both the electrochemistry and microbiology is of paramount importance in order to achieve industrial-scale development of MFCs. This review gives an overview of the current field and knowledge in regards to MFCs and discusses the known mechanisms underpinning MFC technology, which allows bacteria to facilitate in electron transfer processes. This review focusses specifically on enhancing the performance of MFCs, with the key intrinsic factor currently limiting power output from MFCs being the rate of electron transfer to/from the anode; the use of advanced carbon-based materials as electrode surfaces is discussed.

TI  - Electricity generation from wastewater using a microbial fuel cell by using mixed bacterial culture
PY  - 2017
AB  - A microbial fuel cell (MFC) is a device that uses microorganisms as biocatalysts to transform chemical energy into electricity. This study demonstrated the electricity generation from the synthetic wastewater in a two chambered microbial fuel cell (MFC) inoculated with a mixed culture of cellulose degrading bacteria (CDB). With an initial addition of a nutrient broth having concentration of 13 g/l the power density reached 469.48 W/m 2 ; while the maximum voltage reached is 1.0 V. The maximum power for this two chambered MFC was 1.0 W (at current of 1.0 Amp). These results demonstrated that electricity can be produced from the synthetic wastewater by exploiting CDB as the biocatalyst. In this case, the synthetic wastewater consists of cellulosic material and hence the most suitable mixed culture of bacteria is cellulose degrading bacteria. The research study of this kind was done first time and provided satisfactory good results. This method suggests that, if the constituents of the wastewater are known then we can use a bacterial culture as per the constituting elements which can give us the maximum output for bioenergy production.

PY  - 2012
AB  - Microbial fuel cell (MFC) is of great interest as a promising green energy source to harvest electricity from various organic matters. However, low bacterial loading capacity and low extracellular electron transfer efficiency between the bacteria and the anode often limit the practical applications of MFC. In this work, a macroporous and monolithic MFC anode based on polyaniline hybridized three-dimensional (3D) graphene is demonstrated. It outperforms the planar carbon electrode because of its abilities to three-dimensionally interface with bacterial biofilm, facilitate electron transfer, and provide multiplexed and highly conductive pathways. This study adds a new dimension to the MFC anode design as well as to the emerging graphene applications.

TI  - A comparative study for the characterization of polyaniline based nanocomposites and membrane properties
PY  - 2014
AB  - Polyaniline (PANI) based novel nanocomposites have been fabricated by using a simple sol–gel method. The experimental conditions including mixing volume ratio of reactants, pH and temperature were established for their synthesis. For the comparative studies, characterizations were performed by using FTIR, TGA, SEM, TEM and XRD analyses. The structural studies reveal the amorphous and semi-crystalline natures with the particle sizes in the nano range. PANI supported nanocomposites exhibit improved conducting behavior, higher ion uptake capacity along with chemical and thermal stability. Membrane potentials of monovalent electrolytes namely KCl, NaCl and LiCl have been studied at different concentrations to examine the relationship between effective fixed charge density and transport properties of the membrane. The present study revealed that among Li+, K+ and Na+ ions, the PANI–Zr(IV)sulphosalicylate nanocomposite membrane shows more cation-selective behaviour towards K+ ions. Effective fixed charge densities were found to follow the order K+ > Na+ > Li+.

TI  - Transition metal (Fe, Co, Ni, and Mn) oxides for oxygen reduction and evolution bifunctional catalysts in alkaline media
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract In recent years, a large amount of focus has been given to the development of alternative energy sources that are clean and efficient; among these, electrochemical energy holds potential for its compatibility with solar and wind energy, as well as their applications in fuel cells, and metal-air batteries, and water electrolyzers. However, these technologies require the use of highly active and stable catalysts to make these applications feasible. Current catalysts consist of precious metals such as platinum and iridium, which are expensive and block common access to electrochemical energy. Transition metals, and their oxides, serve as a promising alternative to these precious metals. due to their intrinsic activity and sufficient stability in oxidative electrochemical environments. Among wide range of these metals, cobalt, manganese, nickel, and iron, have been extensively explored as bifunctional catalysts, capable of simultaneously catalyzing oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) for energy storage and conversion. Not only do they show innate electrochemical capabilities, but their structural diversity, as well as their ability to be mixed, doped, and combined with other materials such as graphene, make transition metal oxides a highly attractive subject in electrochemical and materials research. This review serves to summarize the research currently available concerning transition metal oxides, and their applications as a bifunctional catalyst for the utilized fuel cells and rechargeable metal-air batteris in alkaline media. Particularly, oxide synthesis and their structural properties are related to their electrochemical abilities, along with their behavior when introduced to other catalytic materials and dopants.

TI  - Characterization of microbial fuel cells enriched using Cr(VI)-containing sludge.
PY  - 2011
AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) were successfully enriched using sludge contaminated with Cr(VI) and their characteristics were investigated. After enrichment, the charge of the final 10 peaks was 0.51 C +/- 1.16%, and the anodic electrode was found to be covered with a biofilm. The enriched MFCs removed 93% of 5 mg/l Cr(VI) and 61% of 25 mg/l Cr(VI). 16S rDNA DGGE profiles from the anodic electrode indicated that beta-Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Acinetobacter sp. dominated. This study is the first to report that electrochemically active and Cr(VI)-reducing bacteria could be enriched in the anode compartment of MFCs using Cr(VI)-containing sludge and demonstrates the Cr(VI) removal capability of such MFCs.

TI  - Graphene as a flexible electrode: review of fabrication approaches
PY  - 2017
AB  - In recent years, the technological advancement of supercapacitors has been increasing exponentially due to the high demand in electronic consumer products. As so, researchers have found a way to meet that demand by fabricating graphene. As developments are made toward the future, two big advancements to be made are large-scale fabrication of graphene and fabricating graphene as a flexible electrode. This would allow for use in larger products and for manipulation of the unique properties of graphene to accommodate superior design alternatives. While large scale production is still mentioned, this review is specifically focusing on different methods used to fabricate graphene as a flexible electrode. Various fabrication methods, such as Hummers' method, chemical vapor deposition, epitaxial growth, and exfoliation of graphite oxide, used to fabricate graphene in such a way that allows flexibility and utilization of graphene's mechanical and electrical properties are discussed. Additionally, a section on environmentally friendly fabrication approaches is presented and discussed.

TI  - Simultaneous Chromium Removal and Power Generation Using Algal Biomass in a Dual Chambered Salt Bridge Microbial Fuel Cell
PY  - 2013
AB  - Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC) is a bio-electrochemical device used essentially for power generation and is now emerging as a sustainable waste treatment system. In this paper, we report detoxification of chromium VI contaminated water using algae biomass in a dual chamber salt bridge MFC. The device showed high chromium removal efficiency with 98% removal achieved in 96 h at pH 2. Initial pH of the cathode solution had a significant effect on device performance with acidic pH values favouring high chromium removal, Open Circuit Potential (OCV), power density and anodic COD removal. The power density value of 207 mW/m 2 and open circuit potential of 760 mV was attained at pH 2. Algae biomass driven MFC thus, proved to be an efficient bioremediation device with good power production.

TI  - Polyaniline networks grown on graphene nanoribbons-coated carbon paper with a synergistic effect for high-performance microbial fuel cells
PY  - 2013
AB  - Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) show promise as a technology for electricity generation from waste, and their performance critically depends on the electrode materials and their structures. Herein, a novel MFC anode was fabricated by electro-depositing polyaniline (PANI) networks onto graphene nanoribbons (GNRs)-coated carbon paper (CP/GNRs/PANI). This anode provides a large surface area for the attachment of bacterial cells and high conductivity to facilitate extracellular electron transfer (EET) from microbes to the electrode. Results showed that the anodic current density and power density of the CP/GNRs/PANI anode were much higher than those of each individual component as anode, indicating the synergistic effect between PANI and GNRs.

TI  - Conversion of sewage sludge into high-performance bifunctional electrode materials for microbial energy harvesting
PY  - 2015
AB  - Conversion of sewage sludge (SS) into value-added biochar has garnered increasing attention due to its potential applications as a soil amendment and pollutant adsorbent. In this study, we propose a new application of the SS-derived biochar as an advanced bifunctional electrode material (anode and cathode) in microbial fuel cells (MFCs). To function as an anode, the SS amended with various amounts of coconut shell was pressed into a mold and then converted into SS-derived carbon monoliths (SMs) by heat treatment. Meanwhile, powdered SMs (PSMs) were used as the catalysts for oxygen reduction in the cathodes of the MFCs. The maximum power density of 969 ± 28 mW m−2 was achieved from the MFC with a SM anode and a PSM cathode, which was ca. 2.4 times that of the MFC with a graphite anode and a Pt cathode. The enhanced electrical conductivity of the SMs caused by amending the coconut shell resulted in the enrichment of exoelectrogens and the decrease in electron transfer resistance, which were responsible for the excellent performances of the as-prepared electrodes. This study suggests a promising method to convert SS into bifunctional electrode materials, offering a new opportunity for value-added applications of SS-derived biochar.

TI  - Doping graphene with boron: a review of synthesis methods, physicochemical characterization, and emerging applications
PY  - 2016
AB  - Graphene based materials can be effectively modified by doping in order to specifically tailor their properties toward specific applications. So far the most used and widely investigated dopant heteroatom is probably nitrogen. However, boron is also an equally important element that can induce novel and complementary properties leading to specific implementation in alternative devices and technologies. In this paper, we survey the most recent preparation methods of boron doped graphene, including materials with specific morphology such as nanoribbons, quantum dots and 3D interconnected systems. We illustrate the results of theoretical and experimental studies dealing with the description and understanding of the main structural, electronic and chemical properties of this material. The emerging applications of boron doped graphene in several technological fields such as electrochemistry, sensors, photovoltaics, catalysis and biology are extensively reviewed.

TI  - Denitrification of water in a microbial fuel cell (MFC) using seawater bacteria
PY  - 2018
AB  - The sea contains various microbes which have an ability to reduce and oxidize substances like iron, sulphur, and nitrate. Most of these processes happen in the seawater, but can also be applied for purification of wastewater. In the present work, a consortium of seawater bacteria has been used for the first time in a microbial fuel cell to reduce nitrate in synthetic water samples and produce electricity by oxidizing organic matter. The concentrations of nitrate and nitrite were reduced to well below their permissible limits. Moreover, the growth of the bacterial consortium in cathode causes an increased electricity production in the cell because of the increased bacterial activity. The performance of the cell with a bicarbonate buffered solution in the cathode was superior to that obtained with the commonly used phosphate buffered solution. As bicarbonate is the natural buffering agent found in the sea, the use of bicarbonate buffered solutions is eco-friendly. The same seawater bacterial consortium was used in both the anode and the cathode, confirming their adaptability to different environments. Unfortunately, denitrification was accompanied by the generation of high concentrations of ammonium in the anode and the cathode, probably because of the use of nitrogen gas for sparging the anolyte. This aspect merits further investigation.

TI  - Performance of microbial fuel cells operated under anoxic conditions
PY  - 2019
AB  - Abstract Nowadays, microbial fuel cells (MFC) stand up as a promising renewable energy source. Due to the ability of the MFC to oxidize a wide spectrum of substrates, wastewater seems to be one of the most interesting fuels. Unfortunately, wastewater could contain electron acceptors such as nitrate, which could interfere with the electrical performance of the MFC. In this work, the influence of oxidised nitrogen forms on the electricity production of an air breathing MFC was studied. It was observed that power generation was not significantly influenced when operated at nitrate concentrations below 0.9 mg N-NO3 L−1. However, when the nitrate concentrations were above this value, the electricity generation was reduced. In order to investigate the causes of this reduction, an electrochemical characterization of the MFC was performed. The results of polarization curves were fitted to an empirical mathematical model. From the results it was observed that, when nitrate was present, the denitrifiers outcompeted the electrogenic microorganisms for substrate, causing mass transfer limitations to the electrogenic process.

TI  - Use of Carbon Mesh Anodes and the Effect of Different Pretreatment Methods on Power Production in Microbial Fuel Cells
PY  - 2009
AB  - Flat electrodes are useful in microbial fuel cells (MFCs) as close electrode spacing improves power generation. Carbon cloth and carbon paper materials typically used in hydrogen fuel cells, however, are prohibitively expensive for use in MFCs. An inexpensive carbon mesh material was examined here as a substantially less expensive alternative to these materials for the anode in an MFC. Pretreatment of the carbon mesh was needed to ensure adequate MFC performance. Heating the carbon mesh in a muffle furnace (450 degrees C for 30 min) resulted in a maximum power density of 922 mW/m2 (46 W/m3) with this heat-treated anode, which was 3% more power than that produced using a mesh anode cleaned with acetone (893 mW/ m2; 45 W/m3). This power density with heating was only 7% less than that achieved with carbon cloth treated by a high temperature ammonia gas process (988 mW/m2; 49 W/m3). When the carbon mesh was treated by the ammonia gas process, power increased to 1015 mW/m2(51 W/m3). Analysis of the cleaned or heated surfaces showed these processes decreased atomic O/C ratio, indicating removal of contaminants that interfered with charge transfer. Ammonia gas treatment also increased the atomic N/C ratio, suggesting that this process produced nitrogen related functional groups that facilitated electron transfer. These results show that low cost heat-treated carbon mesh materials can be used as the anode in an MFC, providing good performance and even exceeding performance of carbon cloth anodes.

TI  - Performance of single carbon granules as perspective for larger scale capacitive bioanodes
PY  - 2016
AB  - Abstract The use of high surface area electrodes, like carbon-based felt or granules, in Bioelectrochemical Systems is crucial for high volumetric current production. In case activated carbon granules are used, charge can also be stored in the form of an electric double layer in the pores, which has been shown to improve bioanode performance. So far, it is not known how much current can be generated by a single granule. In this study, we investigate the current production and charge storage behavior of a single carbon granule. Two types of activated carbon granules and one graphite granule are tested to find the untapped potential of granular bioanodes. A single activated carbon granule produces up to 0.6 mA, corresponding to 60 mA cm −3 granule volume at −300 mV vs. Ag/AgCl anode potential. Charge – discharge experiments show that capacitive granules produced 1.3–2.0 times more charge compared to a graphite granule with low surface area. When extrapolated to other granular systems, our study indicates that the current generated by granular bioanodes can be improved with several orders of magnitude, which could form the basis of an economically feasible Microbial Fuel Cell.

TI  - Increased performance of single-chamber microbial fuel cells using an improved cathode structure
PY  - 2006
AB  - Maximum power densities by air-driven microbial fuel cells (MFCs) are considerably influenced by cathode performance. We show here that application of successive polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) layers (DLs), on a carbon/PTFE base layer, to the air-side of the cathode in a single chamber MFC significantly improved coulombic efficiencies (CEs), maximum power densities, and reduced water loss (through the cathode). Electrochemical tests using carbon cloth electrodes coated with different numbers of DLs indicated an optimum increase in the cathode potential of 117 mV with four-DLs, compared to a <10 mV increase due to the carbon base layer alone. In MFC tests, four-DLs was also found to be the optimum number of coatings, resulting in a 171% increase in the CE (from 19.1% to 32%), a 42% increase in the maximum power density (from 538 to 766 mW m � 2 ), and measurable water loss was prevented. The increase in CE due is
